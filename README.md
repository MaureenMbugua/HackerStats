<p>What are the odds that you will reach the 60th step up a building in a single random walk as determined by a die roll?</p>
<p>Considerations:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Following a die roll, 1 and 2 indicates one step down</li>
  <li>3, 4, and 5 indicates a step up</li>
  <li>6 indicates that you roll the die again and go up the resultant number of steps</li>
  <li>One cannot go below 0 steps</li>
  <li>There is a 0.1% chance of clumsiness(falling down the stairs and going back to step 0)</li>
</ul>
